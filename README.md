# Discord-Bot

Here is the code for the Discord bot I am currently using.

The code is still in development, and the Node.JS version that is currently used is v18.5.0

The dependencies are:
"@discordjs/rest": "^1.0.1",
    "discord-api-types": "^0.37.0",
    "discord.js": "^14.1.2"
    
    Discord API version: 10

Future commands will be added as soon as I finish testing the ones I have in development.
